/*
  # Add Permanent Batch URLs for Attendance

  1. Changes
    - Modify batch_public_urls to support permanent URLs
    - Add url_type column: 'temporary' (24hr) or 'permanent' (never expires)
    - Update RLS policies to handle permanent URLs
    - Make expires_at nullable for permanent URLs

  2. Notes
    - Temporary URLs expire after 24 hours (for daily attendance marking)
    - Permanent URLs never expire (for student dashboard viewing)
    - Each batch can have one permanent URL for student viewing
